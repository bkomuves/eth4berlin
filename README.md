TODO
----

- [x] add a makefile
- [ ] make it possible to specify the output file name
- [ ] make a checksum or HMAC or something, so if the decryption key is wrong 
      but the pattern key is right, then it says bad decryption key instead of a crash
- [ ] add an error-correcting code to the message
- [ ] add a more robust encoding option which survives mp3 etc encoding
- [ ] ...
